## Meaning of max_depth:
max_depth controls the maximum depth of the tree, i.e.,
How many levels (layers) the tree is allowed to grow.

Example:
If max_depth=3, the tree can split the data into at most 3 levels of decisions. 


## Meaning of n_estimators:
It controls the number of trees (or models) in your ensemble.
Example:
Random Forest â†’ n_estimators=100
Means: 100 Decision Trees will be trained and combined (via majority voting or averaging).
